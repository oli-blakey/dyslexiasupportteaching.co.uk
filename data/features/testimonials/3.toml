text = "Daphne has such a lovely way with children, and has built up a fantastic mutually respectful relationship with our son since she began tutoring him a few years ago. Since our son has been working with Daphne his understanding and confidence have improved greatly. Daphne makes every lesson relevant to our son’s school curriculum and helps to build on what he learns at school, we feel our son particularly benefits from Daphne’s use of different approaches in the lesson, combining reading and writing with different hands on activities and games. Daphne is brilliant, kind, approachable, supportive and incredibly knowledgeable. I would recommend Daphne to absolutely everyone, we wouldn’t be without her."
