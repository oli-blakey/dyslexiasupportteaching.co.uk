text = "Daphne tutored our daughter for several years in both Maths and English.  Not every child can learn by conventional teaching methods which is where Daphneâ€™s skills are so valuable.  She has a variety of games and tools that help a child that is struggling.  Daphne understood exactly how to teach our daughter in an engaging way.  She used visual teaching methods that helped our daughter grasp and understand new concepts that she was struggling with in school.  Our daughter always looked forward to going and her reading age quickly improved.  I cannot recommend Daphne highly enough. "
