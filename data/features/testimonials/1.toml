text = "Our eldest son was having trouble concentrating at school when he was 5½, owing to what was later diagnosed as mild dyspraxia. We’d only recently moved to the area but a request for local recommendations was swiftly answered with a deluge of recommendations for Daphne Blakey. Within minutes of our first encounter he was at ease and relished the prospect of the various learning games that Daphne has in her array of tools and props. Either my wife or I stayed with him for his first few sessions but it was quickly evident that Daphne had a knack for keeping him focussed and engrossed. Within a couple of months school reported big improvements in Harvey’s concentration, and we noticed it at home too. "
textMore = "Fast forward to today; he is now 7 ½ and absolutely thriving at school, regularly getting top scores for his Maths and English and is generally happy and stimulated. Not to be outdone by his brother, our younger son joined Daphne when he was 4. We started with smaller 30min sessions anticipating that this might be enough for his attention span, but he asked to stay longer after the second session and he’s been doing an hour per week ever since. School, not knowing that he’d started with Daphne, asked whether something had changed at home as they noticed big improvements in his numeracy and letter formation – and that neatly confirmed for us that it was worth the investment in spite of his age. Daphne is highly qualified and draws on a wealth of experience, resulting in a style that blends modern techniques with a supportive, traditional teaching ethos. Her particular specialty is helping kids with dyslexia but her help with our boys has nonetheless been invaluable. We couldn’t recommend Daphne more strongly – drop me a line if I can help with more info."
