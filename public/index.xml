      <description>Part of our lesson will consist of the development of perceptual skills. These are of prime importance for learning.  Matching cubes- These cubes improve different skills such as visual memory and spatial reasoning, dexterity of thumb and finger and pattern matching on each card. Another game of visual memory, the child looks at the picture for 5 seconds then it is hidden and they recreate the patten with coloured sticks from memory   Matching cubes</description>

      <description>Moving onto a more advanced stage of learning: the long vowel sounds. Using the story mountain board they set the scene with the objects, chose &amp;lsquo;story word cards&amp;rsquo; and go onto make thier own story book. The visual use of the story board gives structure to the story writing, from the opening, building up to the problem and finally onto the resolution and ending.   Sound cards
     Objects for a particular sound</description>
